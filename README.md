[Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)

This repository contains all my assignments I had to pass in order to receive certificate for each course from specialization.

<li>:beginner: Course 1. Introduction to Data Science in Python - that course was focused mostly on data manipulation using Pandas, Numpy and RegEx</li>
<li>:bar_chart: Course 2. Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python - here, I deepened my knowledge about data visualization and its principles. Focus was on Matplotlib and Seaborn.</li>
<li>:dna: Course 3. Applied Machine Learning - in that course I've practiced how to create suppervised machine learning models for regression and classification problems using Scikit-Learn.
