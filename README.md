[Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)

This repository contains all my assignments I had to pass in order to receive certificate for each course from specialization.

<li>:beginner: Course 1. Introduction to Data Science in Python
  <ul> 
    That course was focused mostly on data manipulation using Pandas, Numpy and RegEx.
  </ul>
<li>:bar_chart: Course 2. Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python
  <ul>
    Here, I deepened my knowledge about data visualization and its principles. Focus was on Matplotlib and Seaborn.
    </ul>
</li>
<li>:dna: Course 3. Applied Machine Learning
  <ul>
    In that course I've practiced how to create suppervised machine learning models for regression and classification problems     using Scikit-Learn. 
  </ul>
</li>
